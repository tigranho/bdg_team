Abstract Class Defi nition Rules:

1. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.
2. Abstract classes may be defined with any number, including zero, of abstract and nonabstract
methods.
3. Abstract classes may not be marked as private or final.
4. An abstract class that extends another abstract class inherits all of its abstract methods
as its own abstract methods.
5. The first concrete class that extends an abstract class must provide an implementation
for all of the inherited abstract methods.



Abstract Method Defi nition Rules:

1. Abstract methods may only be defined in abstract classes.
2. Abstract methods may not be declared private or final.
3. Abstract methods must not provide a method body/implementation in the abstract
class for which is it declared.
4. Implementing an abstract method in a subclass follows the same rules for overriding a
method. For example, the name and signature must be the same, and the visibility of
the method in the subclass must be at least as accessible as the method in the parent
class.
